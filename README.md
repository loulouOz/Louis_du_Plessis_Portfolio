## [Worldwide COVID-19 Analytics & Forecasting](https://virus-corona.herokuapp.com)

This dashboard contains a comprehensive overview of the progression of Coronavirus COVID-19 spread. Analytics, and forecasting are available for any continent and country. The COVID-19 data is updated once a day around 05:00 (UTC) - 3pm in Australia and 7am in France.

This is a project that I did in early March 2020:

Being French living in Australia and having friends and loved ones in France but also all around the world, I was curious about the global spread of COVID-19.

I was particularly interested in seeing the cumulative number of cases for each country over time, as well as new cases emerging by day. So I decided to develop a web-based app/dashboard that gives me all this information in one place.

I hope you find it informative.

## [Customer Insights Analytics & RFM Segmentation](https://github.com/loulouOz/Customer-Insights-Analysis-RFM-Segmentation/blob/main/customer_insights.ipynb)

Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value Analysis (RFM) segmentation is a great method to identify groups of customers for special treatment.
While there are countless ways to perform segmentation, RFM analysis is popular for three reasons:
It utilizes objective, numerical scales that yield a concise and informative high-level depiction of customers. It is simple – marketers can use it effectively without the need for data scientists or sophisticated software. It is intuitive – the output of this segmentation method is easy to understand and interpret.
